  <h1 class="title">INDICON 2O18</h1>
<p>INDICON is the flagship Annual International Conference of the IEEE India Council. It has its origins in the Annual Convention and Exhibition (ACE) of the Council, which transformed into the INDICON in 2004, being conducted at IIT Kharagpur. Each of the IEEE Sections have been conducting INDICON in turns, with the last (2017) being organized by the UP Section at IIT Roorkee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the theme of &ldquo;Harnessing Technology for Humanity&rdquo;, the 15<sup>th</sup> IEEE India Council International Conference (INDICON 2018), being organized by the IEEE Madras Section during December 15-18, 2018, at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, with technical support from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, promises to be bigger and better than before. With plenary sessions, keynote addresses by reputed academicians, tutorials, workshops, Student Paper contests, industry exhibits and stalls and most importantly, high quality presentations from the best of the researchers in India, no effort is being spared to make INDICON 2018, the best so far. More details are available elsewhere in these pages. </span></p>
