  <h1 class="title">TUTORIALS</h1>
<p>Considering the large student population in the IEEE India family, it has been decided to have a number of tutorials on fundamental topics in the areas of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering. The tutorials will be scheduled on December 15, 2018 and will be free to all registered Conference delegates. Each tutorial is to be for a duration of 90 minutes and will cover those topics at the level of a senior undergraduate student. Handouts / material / follow-up assignments are expected to be given to the attendees, so that they can continue working on the topics, at their leisure.</p>
