  <h1 class="title">SPECIAL SESSIONS</h1>
<p>Proposals are invited from reputed academicians / researchers / industry experts to organize Special&nbsp; Sessions during INDICON2018, in the areas of their expertise / interest. The Special Sessions will be run parallel to the regular sessions, with the difference being that the papers in the Special Session will be confined to that specific topic. This would be an opportunity for researchers to listen to and discuss research / results in their own areas of specialization. All papers submitted for a special session will undergo the same rigorous peer-review process. There will have to be a minimum of ten accepted papers, whose authors have registered for the conference, for the Special session to take place. The proposers of the Special Sessions will have to keep in mind that the acceptance is expected to be about 25%. Those interested in organizing such sessions are requested to send an email to the Special Sessions Chair (<a href="mailto:ss_indicon2018@cb.amrita.edu">ss_indicon2018@cb.amrita.edu</a>), along with a copy of their CV in pdf format. The email should be in the following format:</p>
<ol>
<li> The subject line should read &ldquo;INDICON2018 &ndash; Proposal for Special Session&rdquo; (without the quotes).</li>
<li> The body of the email should contain the title of the proposed session and the name of the proposer. 3.&nbsp;The details of the session, justifying the need for such a special session as well as the expected number of submissions, names of potential reviewers (at least three) with their contact details, should be neatly typed with 1.5 line spacing and 20 mm margins on all sides, not exceeding one A4 sized page and attached as a pdf file.</li>
