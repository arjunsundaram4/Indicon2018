  <h1 class="title">IEEE</h1>
<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>) was born on January 1, 1963, with the merger of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers. If the initial membership of the IEEE was largely comprised of Americans, today the IEEE is spread over 160 countries with more than 350,000 members, spanning a wide spectrum of professional activities, allied to and complementing its original areas of electrical and electronics engineering. With its vision to be essential to the global technical community and to technical professionals everywhere, the IEEE is engaged in the task of fostering technological innovation and excellence.&nbsp; The reach of IEEE is such that today, there is perhaps no area of human activity, which remains unaffected by it. The IEEE, having grown into the largest technical professional organization in the world, serves its members through a number of platforms like societies, journals, transactions, magazines, conferences and industry standards. </span></p>

  <h1 class="title">IEEE INDIA COUNCIL</h1>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://sites.ieee.org/indiacouncil/about-ieee/">IEEE India Council</a>, established in 1973, is one of the five councils in Region 10 (Asia &ndash; Pacific) of the IEEE. It coordinates the activities of the IEEE in India, carried out through the various sections and chapters. With a membership of about 48,500, the IEEE India Council is one of the most active in Region 10, with the top five positions being occupied by India Council Sections. The IEEE India Council has been very successful in motivating the student community to take part in IEEE activities, as is evident with the large number of student members. </span></p>

  <h1 class="title">IEEE MADRAS SECTION</h1>
<p>One of the largest of the IEEE India Council, the <a target="_blank" href="http://sites.ieee.org/madras/">IEEE Madras Section</a>, received the 2017 IEEE Region 10 Outstanding Large Section Award. The Section has 24 Technical Society Chapters and 3 Affinity Groups attached to it. Formally recognized as a Section in 1978, the IEEE Madras Section is celebrating its fortieth anniversary this year. The Madras section organized the second INDICON in 2005, at IIT Madras. It is perhaps befitting that the section is celebrating its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary, by organising the 15<sup>th</sup> INDICON, at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. The Section chaired by Dr. P. A. Manoharan, is looking to increase the strength of the membership as well as to energise the existing members to contribute to section activities.</span></p>
